/*
Your first function getAndPrintHTMLChunks will utilize the https library to GET a given URL.
You can use the example above as a reference or template.
This function should console.log each chunk of data as it is received, concatenated with a newline character ('\n') so you can visualize each chunk.
Remember in this and each subsequent Step - you will always need to invoke (call) the function you wrote.

Considerations:
Should you require https inside or outside of the function? Does it matter in this case? If not, in what situations would it matter?
Which of the stream function options ('data', 'error', 'end', 'finish') do you need to use to log the data chunks as they come in?
What do you notice about the results? Do you think this is the best way to handle the incoming data? How could we improve upon this?
